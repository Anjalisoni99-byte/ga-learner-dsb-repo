### Project Overview

 Hello all, this project is based on  mainly combining many data types of Python in just a single module.We have created  list,dictionary and performed operations like concate,max,min,id function etc.Finally we came up  with a student  having highest marks in a particular field and printing certificate name.


### Learnings from the project

 I learned a lot about all data types,functions etc.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I just kept reading one by one all the modules and also practised coding in hand.


### Challenges faced

 I did'not face that much of difficulty as i have learned Python earlier ..just the editor sometimes was not working well.



### Additional pointers

 There is nothing to say more ..had a great experience.
Thank you
